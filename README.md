## Rescue Maze Preface

Rules can be found at: https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-maze/

" The robot needs to search through a maze for victims. The robot should not find the fastest path through the maze, instead it should explore as much of the maze as possible . The robot will get points for each victim found and will deliver a rescue kit close to the victim. The robot must avoid areas with a black floor.

Rescue Maze sub-league open to students from age 13 up to and including 19 years of age (age as of 1st of July).Team members may compete in Rescue Line twice (2 international events). After competing in Rescue Line twice, they must move to Rescue Maze. "

## CAD Models

The folder 'models' contains all 3D files used and made during the prototyping/simulation phase of the project, using AutoCAD 2017.  Drawing-SALLES_X.dwg refers to different versions of the robot concept, while pá_X.dwg is a custom servo shovel design to facilitate rescue kit dropping. 

All printable files are in .stl files, and they are mechanically self-sufficient for the static assembly of the entire robot structure (aside from screws, standoffs, etc.).

## Hardware Components

The robot consists of:

1. 

## Team Description Paper 

In order to attend the Latin American Robotics Competition, every team must submit a TDP which shows the engineering strategies implemented. The following text (written in Brazillian Portuguese) summarizes these points in the IEEE text format: 'TDP' ---> TDP.pdf / TDP.docx

## Software

Code that is run during scored runs is stored in the 'ENNARD' folder. ENNARD.ino is the main C++ script, while low-level component interactions are handled by each header file.

'TestModes' contains debugging scripts for each component.

Multiple strategies for the identification of the new "Visual victims" (H, S and U letters)
